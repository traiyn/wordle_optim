# wordle_optim

## Overview
#### wordle_optim is an exploration of the mechanics behind solving the popular word puzzle game, Wordle.
#### I will leverage information theory and statistical analysis to build a 'bot' to maintain an average sub-4 solve attempts.

### Roadmap

Step 1) To evaluate various solution paths, I first needed to recreate the game. Here lives a simple command line version.

Step 2) Then it was time to bring in some data surrounding the English language. Leveraging letter frequencies among common English words gave insight into those letters' distribution across the 5 available slots within the game.

Step 3) Apply information theory by measuring the entropy of guesses and remaining solutions available.

Step 4) Decide on an algorithm for optimal solving.

Step 5) Deploy the bot to play daily, like me!

Step 6) Continually improve the algorithm where available.
